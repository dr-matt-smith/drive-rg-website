Matt holds a taught masters in Applied Artificial Intelligence and a doctorate in applied artificial intelligence and interactive music education research. Matt has published in these fields in internationally referred book chapters and conference papers, has chaired international research conference workshops and was lead editor of a collected edition of multimedia research papers. His main research areas are multimedia education systems and the use of IT to support informal learning. Matt has worked in these fields as a research consultant for UK universities and the British Educational and Communications Technology Agency. Matt has also worked in industry as a programmer-analyst, technical author, trainer and database developer. At ITB, Matt has pioneered the use of Unity game authoring as a means of imparting multimedia and programming skills to undergraduate students (updating things from previous use of Macromedia Flash). One of the European projects he has worked on involves Java mobile phone games and computing science education.",

In addition to this role, Robert is Chairperson of the Irish Deaf Research Network and currently holds an Assistant Adjunct professor post at the Centre for Deaf Studies (CDS), Trinity Collage Dublin. After a number of years working in the computer industry, with companies such as Siemens and Data Electronics, Robert took a multimedia role at the Irish Deaf Society (IDS) where he gained an interest in sign languages and first learned Irish Sign Language (ISL). Upon leaving the IDS in 2009, Robert began a full-time post as a research fellow at the Center for Next Generation Localisation (CNGL) in Dublin City University (DCU). At DCU, Robert was part of a team that created a multimodal corpus with content in ISL video, English text, HamNoSys and computer-generated ISL through 3D avatar technologies. During the same period, Robert began lecturing at the School of Informatics & Engineering, TU Dublin – Blanchardstown campus (previously ITB). He currently delivers a range of multimedia modules on the Computing and Creative Digital Media programmes at TU Dublin as well as delivering a Sign Language Linguistics module at the CDS. Robert refined his skills with 3D modelling and animation technologies while completing a M.Sc by research, which explored the role of emotional and facial expression in synthesised sign language avatars. Now undertaking a Ph.D, Robert continues his work with the non-manual features of ISL from a formal linguistic perspective.",

During his work experience at the Simulator Research Group in ITB, under direction of Dr Catherine Deegan, Kris has developed a prototype for a pedestrian crosswalk simulator, using a Unity game engine and the Head Mounted Display (Oculus Rift DK2). Building on his experience in game design and simulator development, Kris’ Final Year Project was a prototype of a serious game designed to teach children how to cross a road safely, by utilising repetitive practical applications of the skills needed to cross the road safely as one of the core game mechanics. Kris successfully applied for a research scholarship to work with Dr Matt Smith to further work on the problem of quantifiably measuring presence in Virtual Environments.",
